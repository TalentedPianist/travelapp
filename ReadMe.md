# My Travel App
<p>This repository contains a travel app that was created as part of my course at University of the West of Scotland.  To install the app on your device, please follow these steps:</p>

* Visit the link <a href="https://expo.dev/preview/update?message=Final%20changes!!&updateRuntimeVersion=1.0.0&createdAt=2025-04-22T05%3A29%3A44.194Z&slug=exp&projectId=105e583f-b44d-4c4b-9405-2a0c949ed441&group=e4f63c2e-2c32-461e-a98e-f845b86a5440" target="_blank">here</a>.
* Use your camera on your phone to scan the QR code, which will allow you to preview the app on your device.
* If you are an advanced user, you can click <b>Advanced</b> and choose the development environment you wish to run.
* For this project, it is preferrable to choose Expo Go for the environment.

        <td>For Expo Go, you should see the web page illustrated on the right.</td>

<p>Now you will find more detailed instructions of how to use the app below.</p>

# Chosen Feature

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>1.  <img src="images/search-form-dropdownlist-screenshot.png"></td>
        <td>2.  <img src="images/hotels-list-screenshot.png"></td>
        <td>3.  <img src="images/hotel-modal-popup-screenshot.png"></td>
        <td>4.  <img src="images/home-page-after-saved-hotel.png"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

# About Us Page

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/about-us-page.png"></td>
        <td>The about us page is very generic, with lots of room for improvement.  It simply contains lorem ipsum generated text inside a scroll view.  It should be remembered that this app is a school project and will not necessarily be published.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

# Register Page

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>The register page attempts to improve the user interface design ever so slightly by adding icons to the input fields.  It is a standard registration page that validates user input and creates a new user account.  It should be noted that mobile development is very different to web development, so only one user can be created.</td>
        <td><img src="images/register-page.png"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

# Login Page

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/login-screenshot.png"></td>
        <td>Again, the login page has a very basic user interface with a simple login form to enter your email address and password.  The interface could be vastly improved by adding a link to reset your password.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
